After considering building my own UI and mapping framework, I decided to just build off of the Conqueror of Empires codebase I found in PyGames project listing. I also considered scraping sprites from advanced wars or other similar games, but the ones in the codebase seem fine to start.

To actually get going I decided to set some small achievale goals:

1. Text screen to give back story
2. Menu to choose to spend money on intelligence

Looking into the program flow, I should add states to project/control/controller.py
